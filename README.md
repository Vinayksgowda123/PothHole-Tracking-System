This system provides a bridge between the public and the government. Citizens can report potholes with GPS locations and images, while authorities use a centralized dashboard to assign work orders and update repair statuses.
GPS Reporting: Automatically captures latitude and longitude when a report is submitted.

Interactive Map: Admin dashboard displays all potholes with color-coded markers (Red: New, Yellow: In-Progress, Green: Fixed).

Status Workflow: Tracks the lifecycle of a repair from "Reported" to "Resolved."

Image Support: Allows users to upload visual evidence of road damage.

Secure Access: Role-based access ensures only authorized staff can update repair statuses.
